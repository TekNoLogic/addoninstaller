Addon Installer shortcuts
by Tekkub Stoutwrithe

----- Installing the installer -----
This package will install the 7-zip command-line zip utility to your Windows\System32 folder.
It will then copy two shortcuts into your SendTo folder, one for normal WoW and one for the Wrath beta.
If you do not want the Wrath shortcut, simply delete "Install Addon (Wrath)" before you run RUNME.

If your WoW folder is not at the default install path, you will have to manually adjust the shortcuts.

----- Using the installer -----
Installing an addon you've downloaded is simple.  Right click the zip file > Send To > Addon Installer

**** NOTE ****
If the zip file is not created using the "industry standard" folder layout, this installer will not work.
You should bitch out any dev that doesn't follow the generally accepted standard:
  <zip file>\AddonName\AddonName.toc
